        <header>Through out my life I have seen a nice amount of cars, from the
          Pontiac GT to The Lamborghini Gallardo. I have fallen in love with
          cars that go fast and it has to be two doors. Also being red is a plus.
          I always figured I would want to spend my days speeding down the
          highway in a foreign vehicle, until I laid eyes on big red.
