            <title>The Most Amazing Car </title>

      </head>

        <header>Through out my life I have seen a nice amount of cars, from the
          Pontiac GT to The Lamborghini Gallardo. I have fallen in love with
          cars that go fast and it has to be two doors. Also being red is a plus.
          I always figured I would want to spend my days speeding down the
          highway in a foreign vehicle, until I laid eyes on big red.

          <p> I have always been obsessed with two door vehicles but Big Red took it
          to a whole new level. She was sitting on the car lot all by her self
          surrounded by Mustangs , Chargers , and a few Camaros. It was funny because
          most of those cars were nice but she just stood out like a light in the darkness.
          I walked around and stared at her looking at her physique,admiring yet judging
          at the same time. I was looking for a reason to say no but couldn't find one.</p>

                <p> I have a new admiration for the road and where it goes because
                of Big Red. She is a showstopper everywhere we go and people
              are always complementing on how she looks and even though she is
            mine I still get jealous. Its like I want her to myself but yet I
          want the world to see how lucky I am. </p>
